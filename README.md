Game Description:
The Forgotten Maze is a dark, runic maze that leads to ancient undiscovered treasure. But there is a catch, the player can only survive in the maze for certain duration of time. Throughout the maze, there are valuable coins, increasing the player’s score, that the player can collect or leave if they desire. At the start of the game, the player will start at a random position inside the maze. No single starting position will give the player an advantage of escaping the maze. The user will be provided a timer on the screen to show how much time they have before their player gets killed. The goal of the game is to escape the maze and find the treasure before time runs out while collecting as much coins as possible. The user’s score will be determined based on how many coins they collect and how fast they get out of the maze before time runs out. Collecting coins will also add extra time to the clock.

User Interaction: 
The user will move the character around the maze using arrows keys or WASD controls. This will give the user different options for control.

Goal of the Game:
The goal of the game is to try and escape the maze as fast as possible before the time runs out. While escaping, the player may choose to collect coins to obtain a higher score at the end of the game.

How to lose the Game: 
The player will lose the game if they are unable to escape the maze before the timer runs out. 

How to Win the Game:
The player will win the game if they are able to escape the maze before time runs out.

Scoring Mechanism:
The player will get 100 points for every collected coin and 10 points for every second remaining on the timer once they exit the maze.

Additional Features:
The maze will incorporate a monster that will seek out the player. If the player runs into the monster, it will result in an immediate loss.
